### **4. Understanding Booking Statuses**

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Pending** | Your request is submitted and waiting for an admin to review it. |
| **Approved** | Your reservation is confirmed. The resource is locked for your time slot. |
| **Rejected** | The admin has declined the request (usually due to priority or maintenance). |
| **Cancelled** | You have voluntarily retracted the request. |
| **Draft** | The request is being held for further review or modification. |

### **5. Troubleshooting & FAQs**

* **"Access Denied" Error:** This means your account does not have the required permission (e.g., trying to book when you only have "View" access). Contact your administrator to update your permission mask.
* **Cannot See a Space:** The administrator may have set the space to "Hidden" for maintenance.
* **Invalid Time Slot:** Ensure your "End Time" is later than your "Start Time." The system will not accept reverse or equal times.
* **Forgotten Password:** If you cannot log in, please reach out to the system administrator to have your password reset.
